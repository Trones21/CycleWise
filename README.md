## Usage

### Generate a Weekly Plan
Generate a new weekly plan with tasks from the previous week:
```bash
./cyclewise plan --date 2024-01-01
```
- `--date`: Specify the week (defaults to the current date).

### Retrospective Workflow
The CLI does not directly update the retro file. Instead, users edit the retrospective Markdown manually. CycleWise assists in the following ways:

#### Convert Plan File to Retro Template 
Take the current week's plan and add a `Retro Status` column to the task tables.
   - Status options: `Complete`, `Made Progress`, `Did Not Make Progress`.

#### Retro JSON Export
`goldmark` is used to parse the retro markdown file and create a JSON export.

- Parse the plan to retrieve existing project and task IDs.
  - Generate new IDs for projects and tasks only if they are missing.

#### Export Retrospective to JSON
```bash
./cyclewise retro --file weekly-retro-2024-01-01.md
```
- Parses the retrospective file and outputs a JSON representation.

### Generate a New Weekly Plan from Previous Week
The CLI prompts you to select which projects to include in the new weekâ€™s plan:
```bash
./cyclewise plan --generate-new
```
1. The tool displays a list of projects from the previous plan:
   ```
   Which projects would you like to track this week?
   [1] Project A (Last updated: 2024-01-01)
   [2] Project B (Last updated: 2024-01-01)
   [3] Project C (Last updated: 2024-01-01)
   Enter the numbers (comma-separated): 1,3
   ```
2. For each selected project:
   - Tasks marked `Complete` are excluded.
   - Tasks marked `Made Progress` or `Did Not Make Progress` are carried over with their statuses reset to `Pending`.
3. The new weekly plan includes metadata:
   - `lastUpdated`: The date of the last retro update.
   - `includedInCurrentPlan`: Boolean to indicate if the project is part of the current plan.

## Configuration

CycleWise uses a `config.json` file to store project metadata:

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "Node Visualizer",
      "roadmap_link": "/roadmaps/node-visualizer.md",
      "date_added": "2024-12-29"
    },
    {
      "name": "Link Extractor",
      "roadmap_link": "",
      "date_added": "2024-12-29"
    }
  ]
}
```

Edit the configuration file manually or use the `add-project` CLI command.
